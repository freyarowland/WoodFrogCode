## Code

There are four scripts associated with this manuscript:

1) [NeighborhoodCompCode.R](<code/NeighborhoodCompCode.R>) shows how we computed the weighted effect of competition from neighboring ponds.
2) [RegressionModelsFigures.R](<code/RegressionModelsFigures.R>) shows the Bayesian hierarchical code using rstanarm to allow slope and intercept to vary by pond.
3) [SynchronyModelsFigures.R](<code/SynchronyModelsFigures.R>) shows the calculations for spatial synchrony within years and across years.
4) [YMFmap.R](<code/YMFmap.R>) is the code for making the map figure.

## Data

The data will be published on Dryad (link forthcoming) once the manuscript has a DOI to link.
